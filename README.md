# Technology-and-Operations-Management-Case-Study

- The case study focuses on a Bicycle Manufacturing process, starting with location prioritization
based on location morphology and ABC/XYZ Analysis. It includes calculating product life cycles using overhead cost, revenue, and profit for each product.
- The project involves fulfilling the requirements of HoQ and BOM, creating an initial routing, and clustering processes based on required operations. Route sheets, workstation analysis, material cost per strength, and material FOM are also calculated.
- Other aspects of the project include bicycle size calculation, determining required machine hours and numbers, space requirements, material flow, transportation matrices, distance matrices, draft block layout, MTM motion elements, and determining the number of required operators.
